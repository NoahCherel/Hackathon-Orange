 VeloCloud SD-WAN Edge 7x0 Series I Speciﬁcations
Data Sheet
VeloCloud SD-WAN™, by Arista a fundamental component of SASE, oﬀers converged cloud networking and security services to achieve 
ﬂexibility, agility, and scale for enterprises of all sizes. VeloCloud SD-WAN is built on software-deﬁned networking principles to address 
end-to-end automation, application continuity, branch transformation, and security from the edge to the data center and the cloud. 
VeloCloud SD-WAN provides availability and quality-of-service for modern applications, while delivering security and ubiquity of access 
for the distributed workforce. Our SD-WAN and Best-of-Breed SASE integrations, built on the VeloRAIN (Robust AI Networking) 
architecture are ideal for today's distributed enterprises embracing cloud, GenAI, and application transformation. 
VeloCloud SD-WAN addresses the distinct needs of AI and non-AI based applications as it relates to performance, security, and 
scalability.As a cloud-delivered solution, VeloCloud SD-WAN ensures resilient WAN connectivity and allows users to have ﬂexible WAN 
choices, such as broadband, MPLS, LTE, and satellite. VeloCloud SD-WAN o ﬀers high application performance and availability while 
lowering networking costs. It can detect the slightest degradations and dynamically remediate over one or multiple WAN links, resulting 
in a highly satisﬁed user experience. While most enterprises deploy SD-WAN hardware appliances at their branch locations, a software-
based remote client is also available as an extension of VeloCloud SD-WAN. Moreover, Enhanced Firewall Service is built into VeloCloud 
SD-WAN Edges, providing comprehensive security and eliminating the need for legacy ﬁrewalls at branch locations.
VeloCloud SD-WAN components 
The VeloCloud SD-WAN solution consists of three components: 
VeloCloud SD-WAN Edge
VeloCloud SD-WAN Edge is an enterprise-class appliance providing secure and optimized connectivity to applications anywhere, on 
and oﬀ the cloud. It is zero-touch provisioned for secure and optimized connectivity to applications. Edge is available in various form 
factors: hardware, software (VMs), downloadable from cloud marketplaces, or Virtual Network Functions (VNF), with hardware 
appliances most widely deployed at customer branch sites. 
Edge automatically aggregates multiple links and steers traﬃc over the optimal links based on Dynamic Multipath Optimization™ 
(DMPO) and deep application recognition (DAR). VeloCloud SD-WAN Edge supports high availability (HA) deployment models and can 
easily integrate into an existing network. 
Edge also oﬀers an Enhanced Firewall Service, which includes functions such as IDS/IPS, URL ﬁltering, and malicious IP ﬁltering. This 
additional layer of security serves as a barrier between a private network and the public Internet, and is crucial for protecting branch 
sites from unauthorized access and threats.
VeloCloud SD-WAN Gateways
Gateways optimize data paths to all applications, branches, and data centers, along with the ability to deliver network services to and 
from the cloud. VeloCloud’s distributed, global network of gateways, hosted by VeloCloud/service providers or deployed on-premises, 
provides scalability, redundancy, and on-demand ﬂexibility. 
Gateways implement DMPO, cloud VPN, and VeloCloud SD-WAN Multisource Inbound Quality of Service between global cloud services 
(SaaS or IaaS) and each VeloCloud SD-WAN Edge, enabling broadband and private leased lines to appear as a single, high-performance 
WAN connection. 
VeloCloud Orchestrator
Orchestrator is a cloud-hosted (or on-premises) central management tool for VeloCloud SD-WAN, by Arista. Its web-based user interface 
(UI) provides simpliﬁed conﬁguration, provisioning, monitoring, fault management, logging, and reporting functions. Orchestrator 
enables ﬂexible implementation of business-based policies for application delivery and traﬃc management.
