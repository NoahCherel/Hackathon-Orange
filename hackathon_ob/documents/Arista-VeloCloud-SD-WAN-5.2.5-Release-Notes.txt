Arista VeloCloud SD-WAN 5.2.5 Release Notes
Upgrade Paths Gateway and Edge
The following lists the paths for customers wishing to upgrade their Gateway or Edge from an older release to
Release 5.2.5.
Gateway
Upgrading a Gateway using Release 4.5.0 or later to Release 5.2.5 is fully supported for all Gateway types.
Important:  When deploying a new Gateway using 5.2.4 the VMware ESXi instance must be at least
version 6.7, Update 3 up to version 7.0. Using an earlier ESXi instance will result in the Gateway's
Dataplane Service failing when trying to run Release 5.2.3 or later.
Important:  Prior to upgrading a Gateway to 5.2.4, the ESXi instance must be upgraded to at least
version 6.7, Update 3 up to version 7.0. Using an earlier ESXi instance will result in the Gateway's
Dataplane Service failing when trying to run Release 5.2.3 or later.
Edge
An Edge can be upgraded directly to Release 5.2.4 from any Release 4.x or later.
New Hardware Platforms
Release 5.2.5 includes support for VeloCloud Edge models 710-5G, 720, and 740.
For more information, please consult the announcement for these new Edge models.
New Features and Enhancements
Symantec Web Security Service (WSS) Integration (PoP-to-PoP)
This feature brings low latency, high throughput, and high availability connectivity to Symantec WSS via a
multi-tenant Geneve tunnel established between the VeloCloud Gateway and Symantec WSS in GCP PoPs.
Customers can configure a Business Policy to send traffic to Symantec WSS for inspection using this new
feature as an alternative to the Non SD-WAN Destination via Edge capability.
Note:  This feature was released in 6.1 and has now been made available on the Edge for
5.2.5.
Important Notes
Limitation with BGP over IPsec on Edge and Gateway, and Azure Virtual WAN Automation
The BGP over IPsec on Edge and Gateway feature is not compatible with Azure Virtual WAN Automation
from Edge or Gateway. Only static routes are supported when automating connectivity from an Edge or
Gateway to an Azure vWAN.
Limitation When Deactivating Autonegotiation on an Arista SD-WAN Edge Models 520, 540, 620, 640,
680, 3400, 3800, and 3810
When a user deactivates autonegotiation to hardcode speed and duplex on ports GE1 - GE4 on an Arista SD-
WAN Edge model 620, 640 or 680; on ports GE3 or GE4 on an Edge 3400, 3800, or 3810; or on an Edge
5
 
520/540 when an SFP with a copper interface is used on ports SFP1 or SFP2, the user may find that even
after a reboot the link does not come up.
This is caused by each of the listed Edge models using the Intel Ethernet Controller i350, which has a
limitation that when autonegotiation is not used on both sides of the link, it is not able to dynamically detect
the appropriate wires to transmit and receive on (auto-MDIX). If both sides of the connection are transmitting
and receiving on the same wires, the link will not be detected. If the peer side also does not support auto-
MDIX without autonegotiation, and the link does not come up with a straight cable, then a crossover Ethernet
cable will be needed to bring the link up.
For more information please see the KB article Limitation When Deactivating Autonegotiation on Arista SD-
WAN Edge Models 520, 540, 620, 640, 680, 3400, 3800, and 3810 (87208).

Arista VeloCloud SD-WAN 5.2.5 Release Notes
Resolved in Edge/Gateway Version R5251-20250410-GA
Edge/Gateway version R5251-20250410-GA was released on 04-24-2025 and resolves issues in Edge
and Gateway since Edge/Gateway version R5250-20241126-GA.
Fixed Issue 92235: A customer deploying an Edge LTE model (510-LTE, 610-LTE, 710-5G) may
observe that the LTE link goes down and does not recover or has LTE link connectivity issues that
the LTE Edge does not mitigate.
A customer can encounter this condition in one of two scenarios. Where a SIM is experiencing a persistent
error condition, or where it is experiencing a temporary error condition.
A persistent error condition is considered one that requires external intervention to recover the device, and
includes for example: A SIM-PIN or SIM-PUK is locked; a SIM error; or a modem firmware failure that is not
automatically recovered by a device self-reset (in other words, the modem is stuck). Some of these conditions
cannot be recovered without external user intervention (for example, a missing SIM).
A temporary error condition is detected by the modem management as a failure to complete a full connection
attempt, including IP addressing setup in the associated data interface.
Temporary error conditions may be for example: Failure to register in the operator network (for example,
illegal UE, IMSI unknown in HSS, and so forth); Registered in the network for limited services (for example,
PS services not allowed, emergency services only, and so forth); Network errors preventing registration (for
example, failure during attach, congestion, insufficient resources, and so forth); Rejected APN configuration
(for example, missing or unknown APN, failed user authentication, service option not supported, activation
rejected by PDN GW, and so forth); and Network errors preventing data connectivity (for example, service
temporarily unavailable, congestion, operator determined barring, severe network failure, restricted service
area, and so forth).
For either condition, the LTE Edge takes no actions. An LTE Edge with a fix for this issue will automatically
attempt to recover the LTE link from either condition with no additional configuration required.
For the persistent error condition the LTE Edge software will assess the cause of the condition and will
then decide whether or not to recover the modem by power cycling it (only the LTE modem, not the Edge
itself). For the temporary error condition where the network is experiencing temporary issues that cause the
connection attempts to fail, the LTE Edge would stop its LTE modem from attempting to connect for a period
of time to avoid making the situation in the network even worse.
Note:  This issue and the fix for it apply only to LTE Edges and is not applicable to Edges using USB
modems.
Fixed Issue 131462: MAC table is not updated after HA/VRRP failovers.
Whenever a state transition occurs in VRRP or HA, we may end up with an incorrect MAC table that can
break traffic flow.
Fixed Issue 138303: SD-WAN Edge may experience data plane service failure and restart due to race
condition accessing DNS cache entry.
Dataplane Service failure and restart issue is the result of a race condition in the DNS cache where an entry
is being accessed and its reference stored by a thread and then due to context switch another thread deletes
7
 
the entry .When the former thread is scheduled and it tries to access the entry , it results in memory violation
leading to crash since its reference to the DNS cache entry is no longer valid .
Fixed Issue 141113: An SNMP walk may get timed out and fail to complete when the Edge has an
interface configured for a PPPoE link which is stuck in a down state.
This issue only occurs if the PPPoE link on the interface is never up. If the interface is up and goes down for
some reason the SNMP walk will successfully complete.
On an Edge without a fix for this issue, ensure that any configured PPPoE link is capable of coming up, in
other words ensure the peer PPPoE server is enabled.
Fixed Issue 142997: After approximately 4,000 connections have been made to the same destination
(i.e. destination IP address, protocol and port), users may experience degraded performance when
accessing that destination via direct internet breakout with NAT from an Edge.
Due to an issue with how in-use and available network ports are tracked for the Edge WAN IP address(es)
when used for NAT, the Edge may fail to allocate an available port when applying source NAT for new
connections. Performance degradation will increase with increasing traffic to the affected destination(s) and
time since the Edge was last rebooted.
Fixed Issue 147825: Stale entries may be present in the DNS cache.
While sending DNS traffic to populate the DNS cache, entries are created with a TTL of 5 minutes. When the
TTL expires, the entries remain in the cache.
Fixed Issue 148063: Tunnels are not forming on the eHA link while it is in standby mode.
When both CELL and GE eHA links are present in standby mode, they may be assigned the same
link identifier. This can cause eHA link packets to be sent to the wrong link, leading to potential
communication issues.
Fixed Issue 148852: For a High Availability Edge pair, a network configuration may not be applied to
the HA Edge.
In instances where the Orchestrator check fails and a NULL netmask is sent to the Edge, the Edge does not
gracefully handle the NULL netmask. As a result it does not update the configuration for any interface. For
an HA Edge without a fix for this issue, the workaround is to add an IP address to the interface for which the
netmask is NULL. Or you can set the interface to DHCP.
Fixed Issue 148985: The default route in the kernel occasionally disappears after system upgrades,
DHCP lease renewals, interface changes (up/down), or static configuration updates.
The kernel's default route sometimes disappears for routed interfaces. This issue has been observed
following release upgrades, DHCP lease renewals, interface changes (up/down), and other events. While the
exact root cause remains elusive, in one instance, an incorrect default gateway configuration in a static setup
was identified as the culprit. A workaround has been implemented to check interface information in ubus and
compare it to the kernel's default route. Missing routes, if any, are then added.
Fixed Issue 149307: Setting interface Autoneg to off does not get applied after changing the L2
parameter of Autoneg from on to off.
8
Arista VeloCloud SD-WAN 5.2.5 Release Notes
When L2 setting of a DPDK PMD-bound interface is set to Autoneg off with a specific speed and duplex
mode, the network settings get pushed and the edge process gets restarted but the L2 settings on the
interface still shows autoneg On and advertising all available link modes.
Fixed Issue 150646: A customer deploying a Virtual Edge with an AWS type may observe that they
cannot find the latest 5.2.x image on the AWS Marketplace to download.
This defect is to address the 5.2.x AWS Edge AMI to be uploaded to the AWS marketplace from allowing
the upload.
Fixed Issue 150755: For a customer who has configured Network & Flood protection for a Non-Wi-Fi
or LTE Edge model, client users may observe that their traffic is throttled by the Edge Firewall even
though the configured thresholds have not been met.
The Network & Flood protection CPS (Connections per Second) thresholds are not set for Non-Wi-Fi and also
LTE Edge variants, and as a result the feature does not work as expected.
Fixed Issue 151654: A link may not come up on a VeloCloud Edge where both the Edge's Ethernet
port and the peer port have auto-negotiation set to off.
For the Edge port, auto-negotiation is set to off and the user has manually configured the speed and duplex
of the port through the UI. The issue is the result of differing implementations of auto-negotiation between the
Edge and the peer device.
Note:  On an Edge without a fix for this issue, the user should turn on autonegotiation on the Edge's
Ethernet port.
Fixed Issue 151764: Route auto-correction may not occur for Dynamic Edge-to-Edge via Gateway
routes after a route flap.
In the case of Edge-to-Edge (Branch-to-Branch) via the Gateway, the expected behavior is to have the same
route in both Routing Information Base (RIB) and the Forwarding Information Base (FIB). Due to a software
defect, when the tunnel towards the Gateway flaps, a new route is installed into the FIB. Because this new
route is installed on the FIB, on learning the underlay route auto-correction is done only for the route in the
RIB and skipped for the FIB. This issue is only encountered where Edge-to-Edge via Gateway is enabled.
Fixed Issue 151806: Standby Edge restart multiple times or multiple HA_SPLIT_BRAIN_DETECTED
events sent by HA enabled Edge.
Standby Edge may miss heartbeat from peers due to stall in packet processing and this leads to Standby
Edge being moved to Active state. When the packet processing is resumed, the Edge detects split brain
(Active/Active state) and to resolve the split brain the newly HA state transition Edge goes for restart to avoid
any packet loss.
Fixed Issue 151812: On the Monitor > Edge > Flows page of Orchestrator UI, a user may observe an
incorrect hostname for an Edge's local interface IP address.
In certain scenarios, the Edge's Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) engine can extract and give the server's
hostname from a traffic flow that can wrongly be mapped to the Edge's IP address instead of the server's
IP address. This incorrect mapping gets stored in the DNS cache as well, and then gets propagated to the
9
 
Orchestrator too, causing confusion. To handle this, Edge now extracts the hostname and the IP address
from the DPI.
Fixed Issue 151891: The remote diagnostics functionality, specifically the HA_INFO command utilizing
JSON APIs, is experiencing issues.
The HA_INFO command in Remote Diagnostics fails with an 'invalid key' error when executed via
JSON APIs.
Fixed Issue 151892: A user may observe inaccurate Edge WAN link path status on the
Orchestrator UI.
During certificate renewal, the established path in the Edge will tear down and a new path is established.
Here the sequence is: a new path comes up and the old path is moved to a quiet state, does a fast re-init and
waits for 7 seconds for the path to be deleted. When the old path is deleted, the Edge wrongly updates the
connection state as DEAD for the new path and so the path state is shown as DEAD on the Orchestrator UI
under the Monitor pages.
While the status is incorrect, this has no impact on customer traffic.
Fixed Issue 152094: For a customer enterprise site deployed with a High Availability topology, the
customer may observe that the Edge has experienced an Active-Active "Split Brain" state and the
Standby Edge has been rebooted to recover.
Two types of heartbeats are sent: one via the HA link every 100ms, and another via the WAN link every
300ms. During forced or voluntary failover, the active edge should not send heartbeats via the WAN link, even
after restarting. However, this safeguard check is missing in the WAN heartbeat logic, leading to an A/A state.
Fixed Issue 152144: Edges having interfaces configured with DHCP which have IP addresses in the
same subnet may stop establishing tunnels from several interfaces after a DHCP lease renewal.
For example, if an Edge has 3 interfaces: GE3, GE4, and GE6 with IP addresses in the same network, a
DHCP lease renewal on an interface or an IP address update on GE3 interface can result in the GE4 and
GE6 interfaces to stop establishing VCMP (management) or IPsec tunnels.
Fixed Issue 152258: A secure flag for a BGP route may not be removed if a user disables Secure BGP
Routes on a Partner Gateway hand-off configuration.
In this scenario, if the secure flag remains on the BGP route where the customer wanted it removed can result
in unexpected routing and traffic disruption.
Fixed Issue 152283: The interface GE5 and GE6 on Edge model 6x0 types with a 9.13 or newer BIOS
may not detect carriers if the user disables auto-negotiation.
This behavior is inconsistent, but if encountered on a 6x0 Edge without a fix for this issue, the user should re-
enable auto-negotiation on the Orchestrator and save changes, and then disable auto-negotiation.
Fixed Issue 152429: After an HA failover, a few remote routes may not be installed in the FIB.
After an HA failover of the hub, when the tunnel to the spoke comes up but is unstable for some time, the
routes from that spoke may be removed as they are considered stale. However, later when the tunnel
10
Arista VeloCloud SD-WAN 5.2.5 Release Notes
becomes stable, the routes are not installed again into the FIB because of mishandling of tunnel up/
down events.
Fixed Issue 152463: Spokes not attempting to form dynamic B2B tunnels with clusters as HUBs.
When a cluster is configured just as a HUB and not VPN_HUB, we end up not parsing the 'edgeHubCluster'
which ends up in this issue. This occurs only if the cluster is configured as a VPN HUB.
Fixed Issue 152775: An Edge may not update a Partner Gateway's IPv6 static routes with a secure flag
if Encrypt is enabled for PG static routes.
This impacts customer traffic that would match those IPv6 static routes and that use a Partner Gateway.
Fixed Issue 153444: When VNF is enabled, ports 4321, 4322, and 5901 become exposed during
port scanning.
We run monitoring services for QEMU on ports 4321, 4322, and 5901. The fix is to run them on the localhost
IP instead of 0.0.0.0.
Fixed Issue 153640: Overlay routes are not present in Zebra (BGP/OSPF) redistribute tables and
hence advertised to (BGP/OSPF) peers.
During spoke movement between hubs/cluster, upgrade/reboot or during a service restart, the system may
end up in a timing issue. The remote-spoke UP event is processed first with hub reachability when not set to
true. This is followed by remote route addition triggered by the gateway and hub UP event. After the above
sequence of events, the route will be present in FIB with reachability True, but would not be synced to BGP/
OSPF.
Fixed Issue 153924: Upon receiving an ingress packet on a Marvell switch port, the switch floods it to
all other ports if the switch does not have the packet's destination MAC address in its MAC table.
Marvell switches use their Address Translation Unit (ATU) table to forward received packets. If the ATU table
does not contain the destination MAC address, the switch floods the packet to all other ports.
Fixed Issue 155311: The MibTree IfXTable functionality is not working as expected.
The MibTree IfXTable issue is caused by the Python framework's MRO strategy and the lack of 'self'
references for ifstats.
Fixed Issue 155461: Edges go into 'mgmt-only' mode if no routed interfaces are configured.
Edge interfaces support two modes, namely switched and routed. The issue may show up if one configures
all the interfaces in switched mode.
Fixed Issue 155517: The switch experiences multiple cyclic restarts and HA instability when the WAN
port connection is repeatedly disrupted.
We restart the DHCP client on every failover, which implicitly flaps the interface and causes HA instability.
11
 
Fixed Issue 155822: Network traffic may be interrupted for approximately one minute when rebooting
the standby edge device using a Marvell switch.
When using Marvell switches on 610 and 5x0 edge devices in an HA setup, an L2 loop may form briefly
during the standby edge's reboot, resulting in a network outage.
Fixed Issue 155881: Customers may experience random edge freezes when a DNS server is hosted
behind the edge and receives a high volume of DNS requests.
When a customer's DNS server is hosted behind an edge and DNS queries are sent via the WAN interface,
the packets are subject to the DPI engine, even if they have been classified.
Fixed Issue 155974: The Edge device occasionally gets stuck in the initialization stage after being
powered off and on.
During power off, the Edge's log buffer can sometimes become corrupted, leading to failed log allocations and
the Edge getting stuck in the init stage when attempting to log.
Fixed Issue 156376: Traffic destined for a 0.0.0.0 IP address from a remote spoke site to the hub site
may be incorrectly routed, preventing it from reaching its intended destination.
The hub misinterprets traffic with a destination IP of 0.0.0.0 as management traffic. This misinterpretation
causes the hub to route the traffic to an incorrect interface, preventing it from reaching its intended
destination. This issue only occurs when the destination IP is 0.0.0.0 and a static route for 0.0.0.0/32 is
configured on the hub.
Fixed Issue 156458: Users may encounter gateway crashes.
The issue stems from handling external CA certificates. When a CA certificate contains multiple CRL
distribution points and/or Authority Access Information, it can lead to crashes in rare cases.
Fixed Issue 156473: The customer may see a warning that the integrity check failed, indicating a
potential issue with the system.
This may happen when a customer attempts to upgrade a Gateway using an image generated with a different
signing key internally.
Fixed Issue 156637:Protection system does not trigger because the threshold value is wrong in
the Edge.
Customers testing network and flood protection settings on 720/740 models, when configuring a 25 percent
threshold, find that the protection is triggered at a certain threshold, but the actual trigger occurs at a
different value.
Fixed Issue 157187: When VRRP is enabled on a sub-interface in an edge device, traffic using the
VRRP MAC address is being dropped.
When VRRP is enabled on a sub-interface and the edge device acts as the VRRP master, a bug in the code
causes the parent interface to be fetched instead of the sub-interface. This results in traffic being dropped due
to a MAC address mismatch.

Arista VeloCloud SD-WAN 5.2.5 Release Notes
Fixed Issue 157665: When the IDPS is enabled, the /var/log/suricata.log file grows in size over
time without being rotated. This can lead to increased system memory usage on low-end platforms,
potentially causing the system to run out of memory.
With IDPS enabled, the engine generates logs during initialization, rule parsing, and rule reloads (which occur
daily with updated IDPS bundles). These logs are written directly to /var/log/suricata.log, leading to
file growth that can consume significant space in tmpfs, especially on low-end platforms. To address this,
we've disabled direct file logging and implemented a logger callback. This allows the edge to leverage its own
logging infrastructure, which includes file rotation based on configured size limits.
Fixed Issue 157667: Spokes routes are missing on cluster members after tunnel flaps.
Customers may experience an ISP outage on their hub for a few minutes. This outage caused all tunnels to
the spokes and gateways to flap, resulting in numerous CONNECT/DISCONNECT events. These events led
to delays in processing stale route timers and deleting routes from the FIB.
Fixed Issue 157837: OSPFd may restart in an Edge router.
Enabling OSPFd on a limited number of interfaces in an edge router, followed by its complete disabling, can
potentially lead to memory corruption and a crash of the OSPFd process. This is due to the memory cleanup
process, which may not be designed to handle partial enablement scenarios.
Fixed Issue 157898: Link shows as deactivated in Orchestrator for a HA Edge.
After a specific sequence of HA state transitions, we keep pushing old events repeatedly to the Orchestrator.
If LINK_DEAD is one of these events that we continuously push, the link state will be stuck deactivated on
the Orchestrator.
Fixed Issue 157962: Customer may observe tunnel establishment failure.
If, for any reason, IP addresses associated with a tunnel interface are removed, the Linux kernel will also
remove the default route for that tunnel interface. When the IP addresses are re-added, the default route for
the tunnel interface will be missing from the routing table.
Fixed Issue 158032: An Edge router may occasionally get stuck in the init stage after a restart.
Before the logging ring buffer's first wraparound, blocks allocated but not written to since the Edge's last
restart remain unreset. This may lead to problems with subsequent log buffer allocations after restarting,
potentially causing the Edge to become stuck in the init phase when attempting to log.
Fixed Issue 158144: The event 'Edge USB Ports Enable Failure' is incorrectly triggered on edge
devices that do not support the USB disable feature. This event should only occur on devices where
USB disable functionality is present but fails to execute.
Edge devices, despite lacking support for USB port disabling, perform checks for USB port disable status in
various scenarios. This results in the erroneous reporting of 'Edge USB Ports Enable Failure' events, even
though USB disable functionality is not available.
Fixed Issue 158195: LAN clients can not access some tagged VLANs on 5x0 and 610 edges if the
configured untagged VLANs differ.
13
 
On 5x0 and 610 Edge devices, when users configure switched interfaces as trunk ports, the Edge creates
VLAN interfaces. However, this process can fail if the untagged VLAN configurations on the Edge device
differ. This failure prevents clients from accessing the intended VLANs.
Fixed Issue 158456: HA Edge drops all the traffic received on LAN interfaces.
When LoS (Loss of Signal) is configured on the HA Edge, the LAN port is incorrectly blocked on the Active
Edge. This results in all traffic received on the LAN interfaces being dropped.
Fixed Issue 158500: Edges stop forwarding LAN-side tagged traffic between LAN and WAN after
upgrading to 5.2 or newer when the network configuration is managed by a 4.x Orchestrator.
When using a 4.x Orchestrator, administrators configure Edge network settings. Orchestrator uses untagged
interfaces for LAN, meaning it does not specify VLANs in the configuration. After upgrading both Edge
and Orchestrator to version 5.2 or newer, the Edge software fails to generate the correct LAN network
configuration due to the missing VLAN information. This incompatibility prevents the Edges from processing
LAN-side tagged packets.
Fixed Issue 158568: The sentence "WebSocket JSON format response for 'SYSTEM INFORMATION'
cpu 30savg_pct is empty. Usually customer can request for this info via postman.
When requesting system information, the call actually triggers a health check, which retrieves the
cpu_30s_avg_pct. However, starting with release 5.1, we no longer send cpu_30s_avg_pct. Instead, we
send cpu_60s_avg_pct. Because cpu_30s_avg_pct is not found, Postman will display it as 0.
Fixed Issue 159329: Return packets are dropped and NAT table entries are leaked for Internet-bound
flows originating from the Partner Gateway (PG) handoff interface VLANs.
Internet-bound flows that originate from the PG handoff interface are not properly handled in the Gateway
leading to dropped packets and leaked resources.
Fixed Issue 159092: When the active edge in an HA pair occasionally reports its peer as "unknown,"
this can disrupt enhanced HA traffic.
An error in calculating the last seen time for the standby Edge causes the active edge to incorrectly assume
a lack of communication. This leads to the active Edge declaring the standby edge as 'unknown', resulting in
the reset of enhanced HA connections.
Fixed Issue 159337: TCP connections between e2e peers may be disrupted when one side is
upgraded or loses context, especially if the connections use fixed port numbers.
When a customer upgrades their Edge on one side of an e2e TCP connection (e.g., the client side) and the
TCP server behind another edge has also lost context of the connection, new TCP connections initiated
from behind the upgraded customer can become stuck in an established state without transmitting any
meaningful traffic.
Fixed Issue 159532: When the Orchestrator's manual DNS source interface configuration is not
reflected on the Edge, DNS packets originating from the Edge device carry an incorrect source
address. Without proper routing to this incorrect source, DNS reply packets will not reach the Edge.
14
Arista VeloCloud SD-WAN 5.2.5 Release Notes
Users need to select a specific DNS source interface in the orchestrator, rather than using the
automatic selection.
Fixed Issue 159733: NAT sessions are leaked when L7 Health Check is enabled.
NAT sessions are leaked when L7 Health Check is enabled on ZScaler IPsec and GRE CSS tunnels.
Fixed Issue 159845: Severity of some of the INFORMATIONAL alerts are wrongly reported
to Orchestrator.
Recent changes to Suricata rule metadata by NSX have caused incorrect impact score calculations for some
INFO-level alerts. This only affects monitoring and has no impact on traffic.
Fixed Issue 160080: Overlay and datacenter routes are being refreshed frequently, with their age
being reset to 1.
Spokes initiating DE2E tunnels to multiple edges with the same public IP will trigger frequent hub
configuration messages towards the gateways. This occurs whenever DE2E tunnel establishment fails after
N attempts. The failures stem from the lack of defined behavior when DE2E is attempted towards multiple
edges with the same public IP. As a result, the gateways refresh the routes they previously advertised in
response to the hub configuration messages.
Fixed Issue 162024: The {{debug.py --enterprise_top}} may fail and will not display any valid output.
The user may face this issue when attempting to run the {{debug.py --enterprise_top}} command in a scenario
in which the displayed counter's value would have 12 digits or more.
Resolved in Edge/Gateway Version R5250-20241126-GA
Edge/Gateway version R5250-20241126-GA was released on 12-04-2024. This release includes all the
fixes up to Edge/Gateway build R5241-20241112-GA.
Known Issues
Open Issues in Release 5.2.5.
Note:  Release 5.2.5 is an Edge/Gateway Release only and does not include an Orchestrator
component. As a result, no Orchestrator known issues are listed in 5.2.5 Release Notes and such
issues continue to be tracked in the 5.2.4 Release Notes.
Edge/Gateway Known Issues
Issue 151806: High Availability PANIC is noticed on Edges.
Standby Edge restarts multiple times or multiple HA_SPLIT_BRAIN_DETECTED events are sent by High
Availability enabled Edge. Standby Edge misses heartbeat from peer due to stall in packet processing and
this leads to Standby Edge moved to Active State. When the packet processing is resumed, Edge detects
split brain (Active/Active state) and to resolve the split brain the newly High Availability state transition edge
goes for restart to avoid any packet loss.
15
 
Workaround: Increase High Availability default failover time to a higher value may reduce or solve the HA
split brain.
Issue 14655:
Plugging or unplugging an SFP adapter may cause the device to stop responding on the Edge 540, Edge
840, and Edge 1000 and require a physical reboot.
Workaround: The Edge must be physically rebooted. This may be done either on the Orchestrator using
Remote Actions > Reboot Edge, or by power-cycling the Edge.
Issue 25504:
Static route costs greater than 255 may result in unpredictable route ordering.
Workaround: Use a route cost between 0 and 255.
Issue 25742:
Underlay accounted traffic is capped at a maximum of the capacity towards the Arista SD-WAN Gateway,
even if that is less than the capacity of a private WAN link which is not connected to the Gateway.
Issue 32960:
Interface “Autonegotiation” and “Speed” status might be displayed incorrectly on the Local Web UI for
activated Arista SD-WAN Edges.
Workaround: Refer to the Orchestrator UI under Remote Diagnostics > Interface Status.
Issue 32981:
Hard-coding speed and duplex on a DPDK-configured port may require an Arista SD-WAN Edge reboot for
the configurations to take effect as it requires turning DPDK off.
Workaround: There is no workaround for this issue.
Issue 52955: DHCP decline is not sent from Edge and DHCP rebinding is not restarted after DAD
failure in Stateful DHCP.
If DHCPv6 server allocates an address which is detected as duplicate by the kernel during a DAD check then
the DHCPv6 client does not send a decline. This will lead to traffic dropping as the interface address will be
marked as DAD check failed and will not be used. This will not lead to any traffic looping in the network but
traffic blackholing will be seen.
Workaround: There is no workaround for this Issue.
Issue 53219: After an Arista SD-WAN Hub Cluster rebalances, a few Spoke Edges may not have their
RPF interface/IIF set properly.
16
Arista VeloCloud SD-WAN 5.2.5 Release Notes
On the affected Spoke Edges, multicast traffic will be impacted. What happens is that after a cluster
rebalance, some of the Spoke Edge fail to send a PIM join.
Workaround: This issue will persist until the affected Spoke Edge has an Edge Service restart.
Issue 53934: In an enterprise where an Arista SD-WAN Hub Cluster is configured, if the primary Hub
has Multihop BGP neighborships on the LAN side, the customer may experience traffic drops on a
Spoke Edge when there is a LAN side failure or when BGP is not configured on all segments.
In a Hub cluster, the primary Hub has Multihop BGP neighborship with a peer device to learn routes. If
the physical interface on the Hub by which BGP neighborship is established, goes down, then BGP LAN
routes may not become zero despite BGP view being empty. This may cause Hub Cluster rebalancing to not
happen. The issue may also be observed when BGP is not configured for all segments and when there are
one or more Multihop BGP neighborships.
Workaround: Restart the Hub which had the LAN-side failure (or BGP not activated).
Issue 57210: Even when an Arista SD-WAN Edge is working normally and is able to reach the internet,
the LED in the Local UI's Overview page shows as "Red".
The Edge's Local UI determines the Edge's connectivity by whether it can resolve a well known name via
Google's DNS resolver (8.8.8.8). If it cannot do so for any reason, then it thinks it is offline and shows the LED
as red.
Workaround: There is no workaround for this issue, except to ensure that DNS traffic to 8.8.8.8 can reach
the destination and be resolved successfully.
Issue 61543: If more than one 1:1 NAT rule is configured on different interfaces with the same Inside
IP, the inbound traffic can be received on one interface and the outbound packets of the same flow
can be routed via different interface.
For the NAT flows from Outside to Inside, the 1:1 NAT rules will be matched against the Outside IP and the
interface where the packets are received. For the outbound packets of the same flow, the Arista SD-WAN
Edge will try to match the NAT rules again comparing the Inside IP and the outbound traffic can be routed via
the interface configured in the first matching rule with "Outbound Traffic" configured.
Workaround: There is no workaround for this issue outside of ensuring no more than one 1:1 NAT rule is
configured with a particular Inside IP address.
Issue 65560: Traffic from a customer to PE (Provider Edge) device fails.
BGP neighborship between a Partner Gateway and Provider Edge does not get established when tag-type
is selected as "none" on the handoff configuration. This is because ctag, stag values get picked from /etc/
config/gatewayd instead of the handoff configuration on the Orchestrator when tag-type is "none".
Workaround: Update the ctag, stag values to 0 each under vrf_vlan->tag_info in /etc/config/ gatewayd. Do a
vc_procmon restart.
Issue 67879: A Cloud Security Service (CSS) tunnel is deleted after a user changes a WAN Overlay
setting from auto-detect to user-defined on a WAN interface setting.
17
 
After saving the changes, the CSS tunnels do not come back up until the customer takes down and then
puts back up the tunnel. Changing the WAN configuration will bring down the CSS tunnel and parse the CSS
setup again. However, in some corner cases, the nvs_config>num_gre_links is 0 and the CSS tunnel fails to
come up.
Workaround: Deactivate the CSS setup, and then reactivate it and this will bring the CSS tunnel up.
Issue 68057: DHCPv6 release packet is not sent from the Arista SD-WAN Edge on the changing of a
WAN interface address mode from DHCP stateful to static IPv6 address and the lease remains active
till reaching its valid time.
The DHCPv6 client possesses a lease which it does not release when the configuration change is done. The
lease remains valid till its lifetime expires in the DHCPv6 server and is deleted.
Workaround: There is no way of remediating this issue as the lease would remain active till valid lifetime.
Issue 68851: If an Arista SD-WAN Edge and Arista SD-WAN Gateway each have the same TCP syslog
server configured, the TCP connection is not established from the Edge to the syslog server.
If the Edge and Gateway each have the same TCP server and if the syslog packets from the Edge are routed
via the Gateway, the syslog server sends a TCP reset to the Edge.
Workaround: Send the syslog packets direct from the Edge instead of routing via a Gateway or configure a
different syslog server for the Edge and Gateway.
Issue 81852: For an Arista SD-WAN Edge that is using a Zscaler type Cloud Security Service (CSS)
which uses GRE tunnels that has turned on L7 Health Check, when that Edge is upgraded to Release
5.0.0, in some instances the customer may observe L7 Health Check errors.
This is typically seen during software upgrade or during startup time. When L7 Health check for a CSS using
GRE tunnels is turned on, error messages related to socket getaddress error may be seen. The observed
error is intermittently seen, and not consistent. Because of this, L7 Health Check probe messages are not
sent out.
Workaround: Without the fix, to remediate the issue, a user needs to turn off and then turn back on the L7
Health Check configuration, and this feature would then work as expected.
Issue 82184: On an Arista SD-WAN Edge which is running Edge Release 5.0.0, when a traceroute
or traceroute6 is run to the Edge's br-network IPv4/IPv6 address, the traceroute will not properly
terminate when a UDP probe used.
Traceroute or traceroute6 to the Edge's br-network IPv4/IPv6 address will not properly when Default Mode (in
other words, UDP probe) is used.
Workaround: Use -I option in traceroute and traceroute6 to use ICMP probe and then traceroute to br-
network IPv4/IPv6 address will work as expected.
Issue 85402: For a customer enterprise using BGP with Partner Gateways configured, a user may
observe that some BGP neighborships are down and this causes customer traffic issues.
18
Arista VeloCloud SD-WAN 5.2.5 Release Notes
If a customer has maximum-prefix configured on a router which has BGP peering with the Edge and
Gateway, the BGP session may be dropped by the router.
For example, if the router has BGP configured to only receive max 'n' number of prefixes, but the Edge and
Gateway have more than 'n' number of prefixes to be advertised in the absence of any filters. Now if the
BGP filter configuration is changed on the Orchestrator, even if the total number of prefixes allowed in the
outbound direction is less than 'n', the issue will be encountered where more than 'n' prefixes are sent to the
peer before any filters are applied. This causes the router to tear down the session.
Workaround: If BGP goes down due to this issue (Maximum Number of Prefixes Reached), flap BGP on the
peer using CLI (For FRR/Cisco, "neighbor x shut" followed by "no neighbor x shut"), and the BGP will produce
only the desired number of prefixes advertised to the peer.
Issue 92421: When a public and private overlay are configured on the same Edge interface with
different custom VLAN tags, there is a chance that the underlay routed traffic may get dropped.
When a public and private overlay are configured on the same interface with different custom VLAN tags, the
Edge may learn the ARP entries with the wrong VLAN tags, resulting in the traffic being dropped.
Workaround: Avoid using this configuration. This issue is fixed on Release 5.4.0 and later.
Issue 98136: For customer enterprises using a Hub/Spoke topology where Dynamic Branch To
Branch VPN is configured, client users behind a SD-WAN Spoke Edge may observe that some traffic
has unexpected latency resulting from the traffic using a sub-optimal path.
Spoke Edge traffic that experiences this issue uses a route that was initially a non-uplink route for a Hub
Edge not included in the Profile the Spoke Edge was using. A Dynamic Branch-to-Branch VPN tunnel can
be formed from the Spoke Edge to the Hub Edge because of traffic being sent towards some other unrelated
prefix and in this instance the non-uplink route is installed in the Spoke Edge.
As a result of this non-uplink route, all traffic towards this prefix starts going through the
Hub Edge and the non-uplink route becomes uplink (community change to uplink community) but the non-
uplink route installed previously is not revoked and the traffic takes the Hub Edge path as long as the
Dynamic Branch-to-Branch VPN tunnel remains up.
Workaround: Wait for the Dynamic Branch-to-Branch VPN tunnel to tear down, after which the uplink route
will not be installed in the Spoke Edge when a new Dynamic Branch-to-Branch VPN tunnel is formed towards
the Hub Edge.
Issue 110561: Dynamic tunnels may not come up between the same set of Arista SD-WAN Edges with
bidirectional traffic when traffic stops and then restarts.
Issue is observed in a test environment where there are 6000 dynamic tunnels with high bidirectional traffic
being sent between the Edges. Even in lower scale testing at 1000 dynamic tunnels, not all the tunnels
come up.
Workaround: There is no workaround for this issue.
19
 
Issue 111085: When an Arista SD-WAN Edge's WAN link is configured with an IP address in the
same network as the Edge's loopback IP, the Edge uses the MAC address of the WAN interface while
responding to an ARP request for the Edge's loopback IP address.
This can cause ARP spoof and results in the Management IP being deprecated and network disruptions as
a result.
Workaround: There is no workaround for this issue.
Issue 113877: For customers who configure BGP/GRE LAN, those using a TGW GRE will experience
BGP flaps and traffic interruption on the TGW secondary tunnel in all segments when the BGP
configuration for TGW GRE is modified on the Global segment.
When customer changes a BGP configuration of TGW GRE on the global segment then the secondary tunnel
in the global and other segments flap, leading to a BGP connection reset and reconvergence and traffic
interruption. The BGP connection will form again, and traffic will restore.
Workaround: There is no workaround for this issue.
Issue 117876: In a customer site using a High Availability topology, if a user activates or deactivates
the Enhanced Firewall Services, an Arista SD-WAN HA Edge may experience multiple restarts.
When Enhanced Firewall Services is activated or deactivated, only the Active Edge's Device Settings
configuration is synchronized immediately with the Standby Edge, with the remainder of the configuration
synchronization is only in response to a Standby Edge heartbeat. When the Active Edge is restarted
to apply the latest configuration prior to receiving a heartbeat from the Standby Edge it will result in a
configuration mismatch between the two HA Edges and they will undergo multiple restarts to complete the
configuration synchronization.
Workaround: The only workaround is to turn on or off Enhanced Firewall Services during a maintenance
window for HA Edges.
Issue 125274: When a customer runs an SNMP walk, the loopback interface of the Arista SD-WAN
Edge is not discovered.
The Edge loopback interface is a unique interface category that the Edge does not classify as either WAN or
LAN. As a result, the loopback interface is not in the allow list of interfaces to process for the snmp-request.
Workaround: There is no workaround for this issue. The loopback interface status would have to be
individually monitored through the Orchestrator UI.
Issue 130674: IPv6 remote routes may be missing if the only physical interface configured with IPv6 is
disconnected during Edge boot up and only later reconnected.
An Edge will not install any IPv6 remote routes when the only physical interface configured with IPv6 is not
connected to the Edge while it is rebooting and then only later connected.
Workaround: Enable IPv6 loopback, or use a switched interface assigned to a IPv6 VLAN.
Issue 130885: An OSPFv3 route tag may not be updated for an IPv6 external route.
20
Arista VeloCloud SD-WAN 5.2.5 Release Notes
In some corner cases, OSPFv3 does not consider the tag updated by the neighbor for an external route if the
update is received within very short interval.
Workaround: Withdraw and re-advertise the external route from the OSPFv3 neighbor.
Issue 131674: ICMP traffic from a Spoke Edge using internet backhaul via a Hub Edge fails if the ICMP
flow has to be steered from one link to a different one.
ICMP traffic passing on one of two or more links is expected to be steered to a different link if the existing link
goes down or is unusable per QoE.
Workaround: There is no workaround for this issue.
Issue 132492: For a customer who has one or more Non SD-WAN Destinations via Edge configured
and uses BGP, when no traffic is passing through the IPsec tunnels, the customer may observe that
the tunnels are torn down and BGP routes flap.
This issue is only seen when there is no traffic on the path from the NSD via Edge to the peer. The issue
stems from a premature IKE Phase 1 rekey on the Edge and the peer sends multiple Dead Peer Detection
(DPD) packets with an old cookie that the Edge does not acknowledge. This results in the peer side deleting
both Phase 1 and Phase 2 IKE and tearing down the tunnels which also causes BGP flaps.
Workaround: A user could set up a LAN side client to send a continuous ping to the NSD via Edge peer to
prevent the scenario from arising.
Issue 133678: If an Arista SD-WAN Edge is configured for IPv4/IPv6 dual stack, the Edge may lose
connectivity to the Orchestrator if the IPv4 link is down.
This issue can occur if the Edge was activated with only an IPv4 link, and an IPv6 link is added only later to
the device. At the time the Edge is activated, only the IPv4 Orchestrator address is written to the Edge that
manages Orchestrator connectivity. Adding an IPv6 link later does not add the IPv6 address to the file and so
if the IPv4 link is removed, the Edge loses connectivity to the Orchestrator.
Workaround: An Edge activated with only an IPv4 link would need to keep at least one IPv4 WAN link
connected even though the Edge is dual stack.
Issue 135827: For a customer site deployed with a High Availability topology, the customer may
observe multiple HA failovers due to the site experiencing an active-active (split brain) condition.
Under extreme load/scale environments where the flow, tunnel, and routes scale to the limits of a hardware
Edge model in conjunction with aggressive route timers (OSPF = 3/12, BGP = 1/3), the HA Standby Edge can
sometimes miss an HA heartbeat and be moved to an Active state. When the HA heartbeat is resumed it will
report the HA_SPLIT_BRAIN_DETECTED event to the Orchestrator and the Standby Edge will restart to tie-
break the HA split brain.
Workaround: To mitigate the risk of an active-active panic, configure the HA failover time to a higher value.
Issue 135938: For an Edge configured with a routed LAN interface and a secondary IP address
configured on the routed interface, traffic sent to the secondary IP address connected interface is
NATed with the parent interface's IP address.
21
 
Whether the user checks the NAT Direct Traffic option or not has not impact, as the traffic is sent out based
on the NAT direct configuration of the parent interface.
Workaround: There is no workaround beyond ensuring that the secondary IP address is configured with the
expectation that the NAT Direct Traffic option is only applied at the parent level.
Issue 136336: For a customer who configures a Cloud Security Service (CSS) with a Zscaler type,
return traffic from Zscaler may get dropped if the Edge has the Common Criteria Firewall enabled.
The Edge would have a Business Policy rule to backhaul internet traffic via that Zscalar tunnel and in this
case the return traffic is dropped due to a Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) failure that occurs during the route
lookup for the return traffic.
Workaround: Do not use the Common Criteria Firewall feature while also using Zscaler as a CSS.
Issue 138023: For a customer using a Partner Gateway (PG), a PG-BGP session does not come up
when the BGP local IP address and PG Handoff local IP address are from the same subnet.
SD-WAN treats this scenario as two interfaces on a router from the same subnet, which is not supported and
can lead to ARP related issues.
Workaround: Change the configuration to avoid the above scenario.
Issue 139855: For a customer enterprise where a High Availability topology is used and the Edges
are virtual (not hardware Edges), if a user changes any Edge device setting, the Edge may delete the
default route.
This issue is limited to sites where the virtual HA Edges use a unique MAC Address on the LAN interface and
have routing configured on the LAN interface. In that scenario the default route via a route interface (WAN
overlay) and LAN interface may be removed after any changes on the Configure > Edge > Device page,
resulting in customer traffic disruption.
Workaround: Perform a network service restart to repopulate the default routes.
Issue 140194: For a customer enterprise site deployed with an Enhanced High Availability topology
where a PPPoE link is used on the Standby Edge interface, an SNMPWalk does not work properly for
this site.
SNMPWalk output is incomplete for interface related MIBs when there is a PPPoE interface on the Standby
Edge in Enhanced HA.
Workaround: None.
Issue 140785: An SD-WAN Edge configured with IPv4 and IPv6 loop back interfaces and their
advertise flags enabled may experience a Dataplane Service Failure and restart to recover.
Packet fragmentation from packets 1350 bytes and greater is triggering an exception with the Edge service if
configured as above and causing a service failure.
Workaround: There is no workaround for this issue.
22
Arista VeloCloud SD-WAN 5.2.5 Release Notes
Issue 141008: On the Diagnostics > Remote Diagnostics page of the Orchestrator UI, Traceroute using
an IP/Hostname destination does not for IPv6 addresses.
The result from an IPv6 Traceroute shows the destination alone, and intermediate hops do not display. IPv4
addresses work as expected.
Workaround: There is no workaround for this issue.
Issue 141041: For a customer enterprise site deployed with a High Availability topology with VNFs
installed, where the HA Edge pair or either Edge models 520/540 or 610, reachability to the Standby
Edge's VNF from a LAN-connected client may fail.
The Ethernet switch board on these Edge models drops ARP reply packets sent to a LAN client from a
Standby Edge's VNF resulting in a loss of reachability.
This issue was first observed for the 5.4.x Edge build and documented in 102583 of the 5.4.0 Release Notes.
This ticket tracks the issue for 5.2.3.
Workaround: There is no workaround for this issue.
Issue 141113: An SNMP walk may get timed out and fail to complete when the Edge has an interface
configured for a PPPoE link which is stuck in a down state.
This issue only occurs if the PPPoE link on the interface is never up, if the interface is up and goes down for
some reason the SNMP walk will successfully complete.
Workaround: Ensure that any configured PPPoE link is capable of coming up, in other words ensure the
peer PPPoE server is enabled.
Issue 141273: For a customer enterprise site deployed with a High Availability topology, when HA is
later deactivated, the virtual MAC addresses persist on the now standalone Edge ports.
The virtual MAC addresses (VMAC) are programmed on the Active and Standby Edge when HA is activated
to facilitate faster convergence during HA failover. However, when HA is deactivated on the Edge, the VMAC
is still programmed on it. Also, if the Standby Edge is removed and also used as a separate standalone Edge,
the result is duplicate MAC addresses and this leads to switch loop if both Edges (old Active and old Standby)
are on the same broadcast Network.
A user can confirm this issue is present because the virtual MAC address prefix always begins with F0:8E:db.
Workaround: On an Edge without a fix for this issue the user can either force a factory reset on each
standalone Edge to clear the port configuration, or the Support team can remove the /velocloud/ha/
virtualmacs file from the Edge and reboot it.
Issue 143450: On a customer enterprise site configured with an Enhanced High Availability topology
where Dynamic Branch to Branch VPN is also enabled, client users may observe extended traffic loss
after an HA failover.
The issue can be encountered if the Enhanced HA site also has a Business Policy rule configured which
includes mandatory link steering. Combined with Dynamic Branch to Branch, this combination can result in a
prolonged period of traffic disruption after an HA failover.

Workaround: A customer can either remove the Business Policy rule with mandatory link steering entirely, or
modify that rule to remove the mandatory link steering option.
Issue 143828: A customer may observe that an Edge has an unexpectedly high level of memory usage
that may get sufficiently high to reach a critical level and trigger a defensive Edge service restart to
recover the memory.
One of the factors that contributes to this memory leak is extensive use of CLI commands on the Edge
by either a Partner or Operator as part of troubleshooting or monitoring the Edge. These commands are
accumulated and never cleared from the relevant Edge process. The use of Remote Diagnostics on the
Orchestrator UI does not contribute to this issue.
As with any Edge memory usage issue, entry level Edge models with lower RAM specifications (in other
words, the Edge models 510, 610, 710, or 520) would be more likely to experience the issue, but it can
happen on any Edge model with sufficiently high memory usage.
Workaround: Extensive use of CLI commands on the Edge by either an Operator or Partner should be
avoided, and if troubleshooting work is done, the customer should check the Edge's memory usage on the
Edge > Monitor > System page.
Issue 145393: A customer enterprise site deployed with an Edge model 620, 640, or 680 where
firewall logging is configured may observe that the Edge no longer stores new firewall or standard
debugging logs.
When this issue is encountered, a 6x0 Edge's eMMC storage experiences an excessive level of wear due
to the high volume of writes and rewrites that can be triggered by enabling logging for firewall rules which
are matched by a large number of new connections per second in a high traffic customer environment. This
issue results in the Edge defensively moving the file partition which hosts logging to a read-only state, and no
additional logs are stored.
Workaround: If a customer has an Edge 620, 640, or 640 Edge model and is also using firewall logging,
they should avoid enabling logging for firewall rules which can potentially match a large number of new
connections in a high traffic environment. The excessive logging frequency that would result can cause undue
wear on the Edge's storage and trigger this issue.
