Upgrade  Paths  for  Orchestrator  
The  following  lists  the  upgrade  paths  for  the  Orchestrator  from  an  older  release  to  Release  6.1.3  
 Orchestrator  
Only  Orchestrators  using  Release  5.2.x  or  later  can  be  directly  upgraded  to  Release  6.1.3

 Enhancements   IDS/IPS  Enhancements”   
We  are  enhancing  the  Enhanced  Firewall  Service  (EFS)  on  VeloCloud  Edges  from  its  current  implementation  to  a  new  
threat
 
detection
 
engine
 
using
 
Arista’s
 
advanced
 
security
 
technology.
 
This
 
enhancement
 
will
 
 ●  Improve  performance  by  eliminating  double  packet  processing  and  DPI  engines  ●  Streamline  operations  by  leveraging  single-packet  parsing  from  the  DPI  engine.  ●  Enhance  malicious  content  detection  by  utilizing  DPI  processing  results.  
This  upgraded  Arista  security  technology  will  replace  the  existing  Broadcom  based  solutions  and  requires  all  EFS  customers  and  partners  to  upgrade  the  edge  software  to  one  of  the  new  supported  edge  software  versions  as  described  in  the  KB  article.   
This  transition  is  designed  to  be  seamless  for  customers  and  fully  backward  compatible  in  supporting  existing  EFS  
installations.
 
There
 
are
 
no
 
changes
 
required
 
on
 
the
 
edge
 
configurations
 
including
 
firewall
 
policies
 
for
 
existing
 
EFS
 
deployments.
 
 
Document  Revision  History  
October  2025.  First   Edition  ■  Added  Enhancement  section   
Known  Issues  Orchestrator  Known  Issues  Issue  41691:  
A  user  cannot  change  the  'Number  of  addresses'  field  although  the  DHCP  pool  is  not  exhausted  on  the  Configure  >  Edge  >  
Device
 
page.
 
Issue  51722:  On  the  Arista  SASE  Orchestrator,  the  time  range  selector  is  no  greater  than  two  weeks  for  any  statistic  in  
the
 
Monitor
 
>
 
Edge
 
tabs.
 
The  time  range  selector  does  not  show  options  greater  than  "Past  2  Weeks"  in  Monitor  >  Edge  tabs  even  if  the  retention  
period
 
for
 
a
 
set
 
of
 
statistics
 
is
 
much
 
longer
 
than
 
2
 
weeks.
 
For
 
example,
 
flow
 
and
 
link
 
statistics
 
are
 
retained
 
for
 
365
 
days
 
by
 
default
 
(which
 
is
 
configurable),
 
while
 
path
 
statistics
 
are
 
retained
 
only
 
for
 
2
 
weeks
 
by
 
default
 
(also
 
configurable).
 
This
 
issue
 
is
 
making
 
all
 
monitor
 
tabs
 
conform
 
to
 
the
 
lowest
 
retained
 
type
 
of
 
statistic
 
versus
 
allowing
 
a
 
user
 
to
 
select
 
a
 
time
 
period
 
that
 
is
 
consistent
 
with
 
the
 
retention
 
period
 
for
 
that
 
statistic.
 
Workaround:  A  user  may  use  the  "Custom"  option  in  the  time  range  selector  to  see  data  for  more  than  2  weeks.  
Issue  60522:  On  the  Arista  SD-WAN  Orchestrator  UI,  the  user  observes  a  large  number  of  error  messages  when  they  try  
to
 
remove
 
a
 
segment.
 
The  issue  can  be  observed  when  adding  a  segment  to  a  profile  and  then  associating  the  segment  with  multiple  Arista  
SD-WAN
 
Edges.
 
When
 
the
 
user
 
attempts
 
to
 
remove
 
the
 
added
 
segment
 
from
 
the
 
profile,
 
they
 
will
 
see
 
a
 
large
 
number
 
of
 
error
 
messages.
 
Workaround:  There  is  no  workaround  for  this  issue.  
Issue  125663:  A  user  can  configure  the  same  IPv4/IPv6  IP  address  for  multiple  Edge  interfaces.  
The  Arista  SASE  Orchestrator  is  allowing  a  user  to  configure  the  same  IP  on  multiple  WAN,  LAN,  or  Sub  Interfaces.  
Workaround:  There  is  no  workaround  for  this  issue  beyond  ensuring  you  are  not  configuring  the  same  IP  Address  for  
multiple
 
interfaces.
 
 
6  
Issue  130115:  For  a  Arista  SASE  Orchestrator  configured  with  a  Disaster  Recover  (DR)  topology,  the  Active  and  Standby  
Orchestrator's
 
DR
 
pages
 
show
 
different
 
details
 
under
 
the
 
History
 
section.
 
The  user  sees  additional  rows  for  a  failing  DR  state  on  the  Active  Orchestrator  compared  to  the  Standby  Rows  under  the  
History
 
section
 
and
 
these
 
rows
 
are
 
not
 
sorted
 
by
 
time
 
on
 
the
 
Active
 
Orchestrator.
 
Workaround:  No  workaround  for  this  issue.  
Issue  142456:  On  the  Monitor  >  Firewall  Logs  page  of  the  Orchestrator  UI,  a  user  may  not  be  able  to  sort  data  on  this  
page.
 
A  user  should  be  able  to  click  on  the  column  header  to  sort  between  the  various  data  included  in  a  firewall  log,  but  cannot.  
Workaround:  There  is  no  workaround  for  this  issue.  
Issue  142672:  On  the  Edges  >  Monitor  >  Sources  page  of  the  Orchestrator  UI,  a  user  cannot  change  the  Host  Name  for  an  
entry.
 
The  user  can  click  the  Change  Hostname  option,  but  on  the  dialog  box,  if  they  enter  a  different  host  name  and  try  to  Save  
Changes,
 
the
 
Orchestrator
 
throws
 
an
 
error
 
and
 
the
 
changes
 
are
 
not
 
saved.
 
Workaround:  There  is  no  workaround  for  this  issue.
